# Airbnb Customer Analysis Project

Overview:

This project involves analyzing Airbnb customer data to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends. The analysis is performed using a CSV dataset imported into a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Steps:

1. Data Import: Imported the CSV file into Jupyter Notebook using pandas.
2. Missing Value Check: Checked for missing values in the dataset to identify potential data quality issues.
3. Handling Missing Values: Handled missing values using suitable imputation techniques to ensure data integrity.
4. Feature Selection: Dropped irrelevant columns that did not contribute to the analysis.
5. Data Type Conversion: Converted columns to required data types (e.g., datetime, categorical) for efficient analysis.
6. Duplicate Removal: Removed duplicate rows to prevent data redundancy and ensure accurate insights.
7. Data Visualization: Visualized the data to answer key questions and gain insights into customer behavior.

Key Findings:

The analysis aimed to answer the following questions:

1. Distribution of Listing Prices: What is the distribution of listing prices?
2. Room Type Distribution: How are different room types distributed?
3. Neighbourhood Distribution: How are listings distributed across different neighbourhoods?
4. Price and Room Type Relationship: What is the relationship between price and room type?
5. Reviews Over Time: How has the number of reviews changed over time?

Insights:

The visualizations and analysis provided valuable insights into Airbnb customer behavior, including:

- Trends in listing prices and room types
- Popular neighbourhoods and their characteristics
- Relationships between price, room type, and other factors
- Changes in customer review patterns over time

Tools Used:
